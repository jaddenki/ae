# keyframes & animation
> I'M NOT DONE YET SORRY!!!! WORKING ONV IT!!! This is a general example of how a page will look like. I'll put a lot of photos though...


Keyframes are the building blocks of animation. They are markers that define the starting and ending points of an animation. By setting keyframes for a property (like position, scale, or opacity), you tell After Effects how that property should change over time. I'll make sure you understand them!
